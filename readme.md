# Assessment

Welcome to ðŸ§© MiniScrabble!

MiniScrabble is a game where you make valid words from a set of letters.

### The rules

1. Every round the player gets given a set of letters
2. They try and make a valid word from those letters (the word must be in the dictionary)
3. The player gets a point for every letter they use
4. After 8 rounds, their total letters used is their high score

### Your challenge

If you open `assessment/index.js` you will see the game logic. However, some of the code is missing. Your job is to complete the TODOs in that file so that all the tests pass.

Good luck.

### Running the application

To run the application in the terminal, run the following command:

```
deno run --allow-read assessment/index.js
```

To run the tests:

```
deno test --allow-read --allow-env sigma.test.js
```
